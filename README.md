# MiniJava-Compiler

[Compilers](https://cgi.di.uoa.gr/~compilers/19_20/index.html) @ [University of Athens](https://www.di.uoa.gr/en) Spring 2020

## Part - 1

In Part one of the project I have created a program that can parse and determine weather a given MiniJava (subset of Java) program is semantically correct.

## Part - 2

In Part two of the project I have created a program that takes as an input a given MiniJave program and converts it to [LLVM intermediate representation (IR)](https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html) code (semantic analysis is also done on the code). This intermediate code can be passsed on to LLVM back-end to create an executable.
