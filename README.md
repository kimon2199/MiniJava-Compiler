# MiniJava-Compiler

Compilers @ University of Athens Spring 2020

## Part - 1

In Part one of the project I have created a program that can parse and determine weather a given MiniJave (subset of Java) is semantically correct.

## Part - 2

In Part two of the project I have created a program that takes as an input a given MiniJave program and converts it to LLVM intermediate representation (IR) code (semantic analysis is also done on the code). This intermediate code can be passsed on to LLVM  back-end to create an executable.
